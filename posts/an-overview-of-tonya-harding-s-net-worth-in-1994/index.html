Financial Impact of 1994 Scandal on Tonya Harding’s Net Worth In 1994, figure skating champion Tonya Harding became the center of a media storm after details emerged about her involvement in a physical attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan.

According to reports, Harding was earning $160,000 a year from her skating career in 1994, but had to pay out an estimated $145,000 in legal fees due to the scandal. Her savings were also depleted, leaving her with no assets after the incident. Furthermore, sponsorships from corporate names such as Campbell’s Soup and Reebok were revoked due to the scandal, further damaging her financials. Harding was also forced to drop out of the 1994 Figure Skating Championships due to the incident, costing her the potential winnings from the competition. In the aftermath of the scandal, Harding’s net worth plummeted to a reported $30,000, a sum that has only decreased over the years.\n1.
