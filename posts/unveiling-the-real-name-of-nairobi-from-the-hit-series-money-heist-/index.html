To most people’s surprise, Nairobi’s real name is actually Manila. This character is mostly referred to as Nairobi throughout the series, but her real name is revealed in the fourth episode of the third part. Manila is a brilliant bank robber with a sharp wit and a terminal illness. Though she dies at the end of the third season, her spirit remains alive in the minds of fans through her name of “Nairobi”. Manila was known to be tough and she even told her crew to “forget her real name,” and just refer to her as “Nairobi”. It was this strength of character that made “Nairobi” popular among fans and made her a powerful female character.</p><h3 id=1-the-origin-of-nairobis-name>1.

Conclusion: The Real Meaning of Nairobi&rsquo;s Name in Money Heist<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-conclusion-the-real-meaning-of-nairobis-name-in-money-heist>#</a></h2><p>The character Nairobi, who had an integral part to play in Money Heist, is said to be named after a city of much importance - Nairobi. Above all the heists, Nairobi has a deeper meaning that lies behind the scenes. It is the Spanish pronunciation of NECESARIO. This is indicative of the importance of Nairobi as a character and her will to do whatever is necessary to achieve the mission of the group. It is also a sign of loyalty and dedication towards the rest of the heist members. Thus, Nairobi, who is now an iconic character of the money heist series, has a deeper meaning behind her name, which is to be able to do whatever it takes to accomplish a certain goal.</p><h3 id=i-the-origin-of-nairobis-name>I. The Origin of Nairobi&rsquo;s Name<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#i-the-origin-of-nairobis-name>#</a></h3><p>The real meaning of Nairobi’s name in Money Heist is a complex mystery. Though there are multiple interpretations, several theories point to the character being named after the capital city of Kenya. This highlights how the series explores themes of memory, identity, and cultural heritage. Ultimately, Money Heist leaves the reader to decide how to interpret the character&rsquo;s name – whether positive or negative. The series&rsquo; creative team confirmed that Nairobi&rsquo;s name was chosen for its “beauty and exoticism.” And regardless of what the true meaning of her name is, the character and her story have become an inspirational example of resilience.</p><h3 id=ii-the-symbolism-in-money-heist-of-nairobis-name>II. The Symbolism in Money Heist of Nairobi&rsquo;s Name<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ii-the-symbolism-in-money-heist-of-nairobis-name>#</a></h3><p>The character of Nairobi in the Spanish TV series Money Heist has a real-life name, Agustina. It’s not clear why the show chose to give her the fictional name of Nairobi, but it likely has something to do with the city itself. The name of the city, Nairobi, is an adaptation of the phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to “place of cool waters” in Swahili. This suggests a peaceful and calming atmosphere, and it could be why the showrunners chose to give Agustina this name. At the same time, the term “cool waters” could also be interpreted as a metaphor for financial success, which could also explain why the showrunners chose this name for their character. Regardless of the exact reason, the real name of Money Heist’s Nairobi is Agustina and her fictional name is an ode to the beautiful city of Nairobi.</p><h3 id=iii-conclusion-the-real-meaning-of-nairobis-name-in-money-heist>III.
