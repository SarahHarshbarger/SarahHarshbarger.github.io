It is an easy way to diversify a portfolio and diversify risks. One of the best places for investors to start is the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Mutual Fund Window.

Knowing the fund&rsquo;s past performances can help investors make a more informed decision about which fund to choose.</p><p>Next, it is important to understand the fees associated with each fund.

In addition, investors should look for a fund that is diversified across different asset classes to minimize risk.</p><p>Finally, it is important to look into the liquidity of the fund.
