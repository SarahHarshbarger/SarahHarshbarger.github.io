Explanation of Slush Fund Meaning in Marathi In Marathi, a slush fund is referred to as ‘Kosh’. It is technically a fund that is maintained by an individual or an organization to be used for specific purposes. The term ‘slush’ here refers to money which does not have an easily traceable source. In most cases, slush funds are used to finance illegal activities, making it an unethical and a punishable financial practice.\nThe use of slush funds in Marathi can also be observed in the context of budget and expenses management. Businesses in Maharashtra often set aside various reserves and funds that are used for dealing with unexpected and unforeseen expenses. This reserve money is kept in a specific account, and is often referred to as slush funds or ‘Kosh’.\nSlush funds in Marathi are also used to describe a scheme in which government employees are given cash rewards in exchange for completing tasks in a timely and efficient manner. This practice is considered to be illegal in many states and is viewed as highly unethical.\nThe concept of slush funds in Marathi is a complex one, and a clear understanding of the concept is essential for anyone dealing with finance and related activities. It is important to understand the implications of this financial practice and its ethical implications before indulging in it. Therefore, a clear and thorough knowledge of the slush fund meaning in Marathi is essential for proper financial planning and practice.\nI. Definition of Slush Fund Slush fund is a secret financial reserve of money maintained by a company for off-the-book transactions. In Marathi, the term for slush fund is कमण्डली शेत. It is distinct from the company’s regular income and expenses and most of the time, it is not included in the business’s financial statements. Slush fund is often used to make special payments to individuals or groups without the knowledge of the company’s shareholders or the public. The funds are often used to bribe, pay kickbacks, and buy influence.\nII. Examples of Slush Fund Usage in Marathi Slush fund is a term that is directly related to the finance world.

Slush fund is also known as a “Black Fund” and is usually the result of embezzlement.\nSlush funds are used for political purpose by organizations to influence the society by fundings to certain groups. It is also used to purchase ballot boxes and even bribe people to vote in favor of a certain political group. It also serves the purpose of providing money to individuals without providing receipt or evidence of the transaction. Slush funds are illegal and therefore no organization or individual permits the use of it.\nIn addition, slush funds are also used to pay for personal expenses of a company or an organization’s executives.

This helps them to evade the regulations of the government and leads to loss of revenue to the state.\nSlush fund meaning in Marathi therefore refers to a secretive and illegal activity which is used for funding activities that do not come under the ambit of legal activities.
